SmartFridge is an intelligent refrigerator with the goal of reducing consumer level food waste. The system consists of a sensor-loaded refrigerator with a paired mobile application. The refrigerator keeps track of which foods are available and their associated expiration dates. A user can use the app to get recipe recommendations based on the food available, prioritizing foods that are about to spoil.
