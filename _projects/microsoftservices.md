Microsoft recently overhauled the Accounts portal. I was a member of the Membership team, which is the back-end service to the Services and Subscription page. The team hosts an API that aggregates and normalizes a user's subscription information from the various Microsoft services, such as Office, OneDrive, and Xbox. Navigate to <https://account.microsoft.com/services> to manage your subscriptions.
