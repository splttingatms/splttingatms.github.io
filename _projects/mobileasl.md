MobileASL is a real-time mobile video conferencing application for sign language users. The video chat uses a compression algorithm optimized for the movement and setting of sign language content. More information can be found on the [MobileASL homepage](http://mobileasl.cs.washington.edu/).

I contributed to two of the studies which were published in the following papers. The studies measured the effect of variable frame rate and bitrate on the perceived intelligiblity of video quality as well as on battery power savings.
